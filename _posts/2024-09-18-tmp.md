It features recordings from 4 male actors expressing 7 different emotions, totaling 480 British English utterances. These sentences, selected from the standard TIMIT corpus, are phonetically balanced for each emotion. Recorded in a high-quality visual media lab, the data undergoes processing and labeling. Performance evaluation involves 10 subjects rating recordings under audio, visual, and audio-visual conditions. Classification systems for each modality achieve speaker-independent recognition rates of 61%, 65%, and 84% for audio, visual, and audio-visual, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It contains approximately 12,200 to 23,000 frames per subject, captured at 30 fps from around 40 to 160 camera views with uniform lighting. The dataset's size is 65TB and includes raw images (2048x1334 resolution), tracked and meshed heads, 1024x1024 unwrapped face textures, camera calibration metadata, and audio. This repository provides code for downloading the dataset and building a codec avatar using a deep appearance model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| MMFace4D                      | [Download link](https://wuhaozhe.github.io/mmface4d/)                                   | The MMFace4D dataset is a large-scale multi-modal dataset for audio-driven 3D facial animation research. It contains over 35,000 sequences captured from 431 subjects ranging in age from 15 to 68 years old. Various sentences from scenarios such as news broadcasting, conversations and storytelling were recorded, totaling around 11,000 utterances. High-fidelity data was captured using three synchronized RGB-D cameras to obtain high-resolution 3D meshes and textures. A reconstruction pipeline was developed to fuse the multi-view data and generate topology-consistent 3D mesh sequences. In addition to the 3D facial motions, synchronized speech audio is also provided. The final dataset covers a wide range of expressive talking styles and facial expressions through a diverse set of subjects and utterances. With its large scale, high quality of data and strong diversity, the MMFace4D dataset provides an ideal benchmark for developing and evaluating audio-driven 3D facial animation models. |
